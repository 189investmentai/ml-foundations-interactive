# ML for Decision Makers

## Here's the problem with most ML courses

They teach you *what* gradient boosting is. They don't teach you *when to reach for it* versus logistic regression versus just writing a SQL query.

They show you how to calculate precision and recall. They don't help you decide which one matters when your VP asks "is this model ready to ship?"

They explain transformers with attention diagrams. They don't prepare you for the moment an LLM confidently makes up a refund policy that doesn't exist.

This course is different. You won't watch me lecture. You'll make decisions—and see the consequences.

## What you'll actually do

Every module puts you in the driver's seat:

**You'll frame problems.** I'll hand you a messy business situation ("customers are churning, do something") and you'll figure out if ML even makes sense, and if so, what kind.

**You'll interpret outputs.** Real model predictions, real customer data. "This user has a 73% churn probability—should we send a $20 retention offer?" That's not a rhetorical question. You'll answer it.

**You'll catch mistakes.** I'll give you broken pipelines. Data leakage that makes AUC look incredible until production. Models that predict the past instead of the future. You'll find the bugs.

**You'll explain to stakeholders.** Because if you can't write a 3-sentence Slack message explaining why the model isn't ready, you don't really understand it.

## Who this is for (and who it's not for)

**This will work for you if:**
- You work with data scientists but don't build models yourself
- You've taken ML courses before but still can't answer "when would I use this?"
- You want intuition, not math proofs
- You're willing to do exercises, not just read

**This won't work for you if:**
- You want to become an ML engineer (this won't get you there)
- You prefer video lectures you can watch at 2x
- You're looking for deep mathematical foundations

I'm not trying to turn you into a data scientist. I'm trying to make you dangerous enough to ask good questions, spot red flags, and make better decisions.

## How it works

10 modules × 60-90 minutes each.

Each module has the same rhythm:

1. **Read** (15 min) — I explain one concept with an analogy, a diagram, and a real example from our fictional company StreamCart (subscription e-commerce).

2. **Decide** (10 min) — Scenario quiz. You make choices. After each one, I tell you if you were right and why.

3. **Build** (20 min) — Colab notebook. Real data. You do the work, with checkpoints to make sure you're on track.

4. **Debug** (15 min) — I give you something broken. You fix it.

5. **Explain** (10 min) — Write a stakeholder update. I give you a rubric for what good looks like.

No videos. No community. No live sessions. Just you, the material, and a lot of practice.

## The StreamCart universe

All examples use **StreamCart**—a subscription beauty box company I made up.

Why one company? Because ML concepts stick better when you see them applied to the *same* business repeatedly. By module 10, you'll know StreamCart's data inside out. Churn, fraud, support tickets, recommendations—same company, different ML problems.

## What's included

- 10 modules covering problem framing through LLMs
- 10 Colab labs with real datasets and self-checks
- 10 scenario quizzes where you make decisions (not just recall facts)
- 10 "find the bug" exercises
- 10 one-page cheat sheets
- 3 capstone project options if you want to go deeper
- All updates forever

**Optional:** [Appendix: Impact, Uplift, & Production](bonus-appendix-impact-uplift-production.md) — covers A/B testing, why risk models can backfire, and monitoring. Read it after Module 6 or before the capstone.

**$249 one-time.** No subscription. No expiring access.

## What you'll cover

| Module | The question you'll answer |
|--------|---------------------------|
| 1 | Is this even an ML problem? |
| 2 | How do I predict yes or no? |
| 3 | What if the relationship isn't a straight line? |
| 4 | Should I use XGBoost or random forest? |
| 5 | What data should the model see (and not see)? |
| 6 | How do I know if this model is actually good? |
| 7 | Can I find patterns without labels? |
| 8 | How do I find "similar" items? |
| 9 | How do I work with text? |
| 10 | When do I prompt vs. RAG vs. fine-tune? |

## Ready?

Start with Module 1: "Is this even an ML problem?"

You'll learn the 7-line framing template that separates projects that ship from projects that waste six months.
