# ML for Decision Makers

For PMs, analysts, and leaders who work with ML teams but don't build models themselves.

## What You'll Learn

- Frame ML problems correctly (the skill that separates shipped projects from wasted months)
- Evaluate model outputs and know when something's ready to ship
- Catch common mistakes: data leakage, wrong metrics, overfitting
- Communicate ML concepts to stakeholders

## Structure

10 modules, each with:
- Micro-lesson (15 min read)
- Decision scenarios (Typeform quiz)
- Hands-on lab (Colab notebook)
- Debug drill (find and fix the bug)
- Cheat sheet (1-page reference)
