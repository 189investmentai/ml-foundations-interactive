# ML for Practitioners: Course Overview

## The Promise

After completing this course, you will:
- Understand how ML models actually work (not just how to call `.fit()`)
- Know when models fail and how to diagnose problems
- Communicate ML results to stakeholders in plain language
- Build and evaluate agentic AI systems with confidence
- Have portfolio-ready artifacts including interactive dashboards

## Who This Is For

**You're a good fit if you:**
- Are comfortable with Python basics and pandas
- Want to understand ML deeply without drowning in math
- Need to debug models, not just build them
- Work with or will work with ML systems in production
- Want to explain ML to non-technical stakeholders

**This is NOT for you if you:**
- Want to derive algorithms from scratch
- Need a PhD-level mathematical treatment
- Are looking for a quick API tutorial

## The StreamCart Case Study

Every module uses data from **StreamCart**, a fictional subscription e-commerce company. You'll work with:

| Dataset | Rows | Use Case |
|---------|------|----------|
| `streamcart_customers.csv` | 5,000 | Churn prediction, LTV regression |
| `streamcart_events.csv` | 45,000 | Feature engineering, time series |
| `streamcart_products.csv` | 200 | Recommendations, embeddings |
| `streamcart_tickets.csv` | 1,000 | Text classification, semantic search |

## The Interactive Playground Difference

Unlike video courses where you passively watch, this course puts you in the driver's seat.

Every module includes an **HTML playground** where you:
- Adjust sliders and watch metrics change in real-time
- Toggle settings to see how assumptions affect predictions
- Load challenge presets that demonstrate failure modes
- Build intuition through experimentation

**No installation required.** Open the HTML file in any browser.

## Learning Path

### Foundation (Modules 0-2)
Build your mental map of ML and understand how things break.

### Core Supervised Learning (Modules 3-6)
Master regression, classification, trees, and ensembles.

### Evaluation & Features (Modules 7-10)
Learn to debug models and engineer predictive features.

### Modern ML (Modules 11-15)
Understand embeddings, retrieval, and deep learning intuition.

### Agentic AI (Modules 16-19)
Build and evaluate tool-using agents with guardrails.

### Production (Modules 20-21)
Ship ML systems with monitoring and evaluation harnesses.

### Capstone
Combine everything into a portfolio project.

## Time Commitment

- **Per module:** 1-2 hours (lesson + playground + lab)
- **Full course:** 40-50 hours
- **Recommended pace:** 2-3 modules per week

## How to Succeed

1. **Use the playgrounds first** - Build intuition before reading theory
2. **Do the debug drills** - Finding bugs teaches more than building from scratch
3. **Write the "Explain It" sections** - If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it
4. **Complete the quizzes honestly** - Wrong answers reveal gaps
5. **Build the capstone** - Synthesis cements learning
