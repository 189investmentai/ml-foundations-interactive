# Pricing & Packaging

## The Recommendation: $249, One Tier

Don't overthink this. One price, one product, no confusion.

**$249 one-time payment** includes everything:

- 10 modules (micro-lessons, diagrams, examples)
- 10 Colab labs with solution keys
- 10 Typeform scenario quizzes
- 10 debug drills
- 10 downloadable cheat sheets
- 3 capstone project tracks
- All future updates

No subscription. No expiring access. Buy once, keep forever.

## Why This Price?

**Competitive positioning:**

| Alternative | Price | What you get |
|-------------|-------|--------------|
| Coursera ML specialization | $49/month (~$200+ to complete) | Video lectures, peer-graded assignments |
| DataCamp subscription | $300/year | Lots of courses, mostly passive |
| Codecademy Pro | $240/year | Interactive but shallow |
| Bootcamp | $5,000-15,000 | Live instruction, career support |
| **This course** | **$249 one-time** | Interactive, self-paced, practical focus |

$249 is:
- Low enough for self-funded professionals
- High enough to signal quality (not a $19 Udemy course)
- One-time, so no subscription fatigue
- Comparable to other "premium but not bootcamp" options

---

## What's NOT Included (By Design)

**No community/Slack/Discord:**
- Communities require ongoing moderation
- Value degrades without critical mass
- Doesn't fit the "one-time purchase" model

**No live sessions:**
- Increases operational complexity
- Limits scalability
- Learners want flexibility, not schedules

**No 1:1 support:**
- Doesn't scale
- Creates expectation of real-time help
- Would require higher price point

The product is intentionally async and self-contained. Learners who want more can buy add-ons.

## Optional Add-On: Graded Capstone Review ($99)

**What they get:**
- Submit one capstone project
- Written feedback on all 5 rubric dimensions
- Specific suggestions for improvement
- One round of revision feedback
- Delivered within 5 business days

**Why this add-on works:**
- High-value for motivated learners who want feedback
- Async (no calls, no scheduling)
- Can be fulfilled by you or a contractor
- ~$100-150/hour effective rate for ~1 hour of review work

**Positioning:**
> "Want feedback on your work? Our team will review your capstone and give you specific, actionable feedback—just like you'd get from a senior colleague."

---

## Optional Add-On: Executive Summary Review Pack ($49)

**What they get:**
- Submit 5 stakeholder updates (the "Explain" deliverables from modules)
- Written feedback on clarity, framing, and communication
- Focus on business communication skills, not technical skills

**Why this add-on works:**
- Lower lift than capstone review (~20-30 min total)
- Appeals to people focused on communication/PM skills
- Cheaper entry point than capstone review

---

## What I'd Avoid

**Don't do:**
- Multiple tiers (confuses buyers, minimal upside)
- Monthly subscriptions (wrong model for finite content)
- "Early bird" pricing that never ends (erodes trust)
- Bundled coaching calls (doesn't scale, wrong audience)

**Keep it simple:** One product, one price, optional add-ons for those who want more.

---

## Refund Policy

**30-day refund if you complete Modules 1-3 and don't find it valuable.**

Why this specific policy:
- "Complete Modules 1-3" prevents drive-by refunds
- Shows confidence in the content
- Gives enough time to genuinely evaluate
- Filters out people who won't engage anyway

---

## Sales Page Copy (Key Points)

**Headline:** Build ML Intuition by Making Real Decisions

**Subhead:** Not another video course. You'll frame problems, interpret outputs, catch mistakes, and explain tradeoffs—using real e-commerce data.

**Bullet points:**
- 10 modules, 12-18 hours total
- Hands-on labs, decision scenarios, debug drills
- No math prerequisites, no passive watching
- $249 one-time, no subscription

**CTA:** Start with Module 1 →

**Trust elements:**
- 30-day refund policy
- "All future updates included"
- Sample Module 1 content preview (let them try before buying)

---

## Launch Strategy (Optional)

If you want to launch with buzz:

**Pre-launch:**
- Share 2-3 pieces of content publicly (e.g., "The 7-line ML framing template")
- Build email list of interested people
- Offer early access at $199 for first 50 buyers

**Launch:**
- Full price $249
- Highlight the interactive/practical angle vs. passive courses
- Show sample module content

**Ongoing:**
- No discounts (trains people to wait)
- Add testimonials as you get them
- Consider affiliate program for data professionals

---

## Revenue Math

Assumptions:
- 100 sales in first 3 months at $249 = $24,900
- 20% buy capstone review ($99) = $1,980
- 10% buy summary review ($49) = $490
- **Total: ~$27,370**

At scale (500 sales/year):
- Core product: $124,500
- Add-ons: ~$12,000
- **Annual revenue: ~$136,500**

With minimal ongoing costs (hosting, Typeform, occasional contractor for reviews), this is a high-margin product.
